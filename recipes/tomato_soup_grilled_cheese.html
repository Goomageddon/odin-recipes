    <li>Pepper</li>
  </ul>

    <li>75g or 1/4c + 1 heaping Tbsp mayo</li>
    <li>15g or 1Tbsp dijon</li>
    <li>Basic hearty white bread (recipe here: BLT video: @ocBM)</li>
    <li>Cheeses: american, gruyere, provolone</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <h3>Tomato Soup</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 450F/232C </li>
    <li>
      Add canned tomatoes, onion, garlic, olive oil, salt, sugar, chicken stock, tomato paste, and chili in adobo to
      large baking dish or dutch oven. Stir ingredients to combine and roast in the oven for 1 hour, stirring halfway
      through.
    </li>
    <li>
      After 60-75 minutes of roasting, remove from the oven, carefully ladle half of the “soup” into a blender, and
      blend on high until smooth (obviously this stuff will be hot so use caution) . Transfer to a fine mesh strainer
      over a sauce pot and force soup through to create a silky texture. Repeat with the second half of the unblended
      soup. If needed, add additional chicken stock to thin to desired consistency. Season to taste with salt. Hold soup
      over low heat to keep warm while you make the grilled cheese sandos.
    </li>
    <li>Garnish with chives, olive oil, parm, and black pepper.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Grilled Cheese</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Add butter, mayo, and dijon to food processor. Process until smooth. Set aside. </li>
    <li>Preheat nonstick pan over medium low heat. </li>
    <li>Liberally spread butter/mayo/mustard mixture over one side of two slices of bread. </li>
    <li>
      Flip to non buttered side and layer down cheeses - slice american, slices gruyere, slice provolone, and another
      slice of american.
    </li>
    <li>
      Place in skillet,pressing down with spatula for about 30 seconds. Cook for additional 90 seconds or until side
      one reaches desired amount of brown. Flip to the second side and toast for an additional two minutes or until side
      two is golden brown and cheeses are melty.
    </li>
