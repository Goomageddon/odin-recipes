      <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
      <li>4 pounds beef short ribs</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil oil</li>
      <li>1 cup water</li>
      <li>1 cup stewed tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
      <li>6 celery stalks, chopped</li>
      <li>3 onions, chopped</li>
      <li>6 carrots, chopped</li>
      <li>1/3 cup of red wine</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 350°. Season short ribs with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high.
         Working in 2 batches, brown short ribs on all sides, about 8 minutes per batch. Transfer short ribs to a plate. 
         Pour off all but 3 Tbsp. drippings from pot.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add onions, carrots, and celery to pot and cook over medium-high heat, stirring often, until onions are browned, about 5 minutes. Add flour and tomato paste; cook, stirring constantly,
        until well combined and deep red, 2-3 minutes. Stir in wine, then add short ribs with any accumulated juices.
        Bring to a boil; lower heat to medium and simmer until wine is reduced by half, about 25 minutes. Add all herbs to pot along with garlic.
        Stir in stock. Bring to a boil, cover, and transfer to oven.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook until short ribs are tender, 2–2½ hours. Transfer short ribs to a platter. Strain sauce from pot into a measuring cup.
        Spoon fat from surface of sauce and discard; season sauce to taste with salt and pepper. Serve in shallow bowls over mashed potatoes 
        with sauce spooned over.
