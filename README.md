# odin-recipes
Repo for my first Odin Project recipe website
---------------------------------------------

Pre-project expectations and project explanation

In this project I will make a recipe website with multiple pages: Index.html, an recipe pages within   recipes/*.html. Each page will make use of the skills I have learned so far such as links, lists, semantic options like strong and em, h1-h6, paragraphs, images, attributes and alt text as well as  general HTML5 code format and boilerplate. During this project, I will practice good version control habits and provide concise, meaningful and easy to read commit messages.
